    <h2>The History of the Mk1 Scirocco</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Volkswagen Scirocco was undoubtedly a risky decision for Karmann, but
      he had his confidence<br />
      placed in the creator of the Golf, Giorgetto Giugiaro. Together they
      started The History of the Mk1<br />
      Scirocco and made of this car a compact sporty one.

      This is a three-door hatchback with front engine and front-wheel drive, it
      was manufactured in<br />
      Osnabrück, Germany. Work was done on the first-generation Scirocco during
      the 1970s to replace the<br />
      Karmann Ghia, they reused the chassis of the VW Golf I, but emphasis was
      placed on “sportiness”<br />
      in both handling and design.

      The History of the Mk1 Scirocco tells us that it first appeared to the
      public at the Geneva Motor Show<br />
      in March 1974. They said, “Scirocco, a sporty coupe at its best”, was
      definitely very popular with the<br />
      public.

      The model was sold in Europe in 1974 and in North America in 1975. The
      range consisted solely of <br />
      in-line 4-cylinder gasoline engines with a single camshaft and two valves
      per cylinder: a 1.1-liter<br />
      50-hp, a 1.3 liter 60 hp, a 1.5 liter 70 or 85 hp, a 1.6 liter 75, 85 or
      110 hp and a 1.7 liter with fuel <br />
      injection that offered 74 hp for the North American market.

    <p>
      The first year of sales was 24,555 Sciroccos, followed by 58,942 in 1975,
      6,000 more than planned,<br />
      in 1977 and 1978 were more than 87,000 cars a year. A total of 504,153
      units of the Scirocco I,<br />
      were produced. I definitely think the Scirocco provided a breath of fresh
      air, with its spirit and<br />
      sporting image. Have you ever seen or know of someone who has one?
